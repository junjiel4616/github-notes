### Git
Git is a software program that allows you to control your versions. So in simple terms it allows you to keep control of which version you would want to switch to. For example you change a text to yellow, but decide you didn't like it so you changed it to blue, and then you added some more writing, but then again you decided yellow is better, you can manually make it all yellow again or you can change it back to yellow with its specific version, with most websites it wouldn't keep any pervious work so you'll lose all the things you wrote down, but with git you can go back to yellow without having to get rid of text.
### GitHub 
GitHub is just basically a web service that has git already pre prepared in it so you wouldn't have to have git on your thing itself. Really not much to say about it but that it just a easier way to manage your work instead of having git actually on your device.
### Repo
Github's repository is just another word for your projects. It allows you to create a project that can have maybe files attached to it. 
### Commit
Commit basically allows you to save your work. And with commit you can save those certain changes into versions that you can detail, it is so that it makes it easier to go back and find later on if you plan to change something.
