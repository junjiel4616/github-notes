### Git
Git is a software program that allows you to control your versions. So in simple terms it allows you to keep control of which version you would want to switch to. For example you change a text to yellow, but decide you didn't like it so you changed it to blue, and then you added some more writing, but then again you decided yellow is better, you can manually make it all yellow again or you can change it back to yellow with its specific version, with most websites it wouldn't keep any pervious work so you'll lose all the things you wrote down, but with git you can go back to yellow without having to get rid of text.
